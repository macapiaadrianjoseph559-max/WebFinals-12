## 🕹️ How the Game Works
- The game begins with you waking up on the island.
- You are given three main paths to explore:
  - **Cabin**: A dark and mysterious cabin that may hide treasure… or danger.
  - **Forest**: A quiet forest where you might find powerful items—or face deadly creatures.
  - **Village**: A small settlement where you can meet people or rest.

- At each location, you’ll be asked to make a choice.  
  Example: In the cabin, you can **turn on the light** or **run away**.  
- Your decisions lead to different outcomes:
  - Some choices let you **win** or **survive**.
  - Other choices lead to **Game Over**.
- There are multiple endings depending on the path you take.
